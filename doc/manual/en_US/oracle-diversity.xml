    <title>Diversity and Inclusion</title>
    <para> Oracle is fully committed to diversity and inclusion. Oracle recognizes the influence of
        ethnic and cultural values and is working to remove language from our products and
        documentation that might be considered insensitive. While doing so, we are also mindful of
        the necessity to maintain compatibility with our customers' existing technologies and the
        need to ensure continuity of service as Oracle's offerings and industry standards evolve.
        Because of these technical constraints, our effort to remove insensitive terms is an
        ongoing, long-term process.</para>
