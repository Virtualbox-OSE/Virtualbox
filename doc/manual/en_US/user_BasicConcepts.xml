  <title>Configuring Virtual Machines</title>

  <para>
    This chapter provides detailed steps for configuring an
    &product-name; virtual machine (VM). For an introduction to

    You have considerable latitude when deciding what virtual hardware
    to provide to the guest. Use virtual hardware to communicate with
    the host system or with other guests. For example, you can use
    virtual hardware in the following ways:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Have &product-name; present an ISO CD-ROM image to a guest

        Provide a guest system access to the physical network through
        its virtual network card.

        Provide the host system, other guests, and computers on the

        &product-name; enables you to install and execute unmodified
        versions of Mac OS X guests on supported host hardware. Note
        that this feature is experimental and thus unsupported.
      </para>

      <para>
        &product-name; is the first product to provide the modern PC
        architecture expected by OS X without requiring any of the
        modifications used by competing virtualization solutions. For
        example, some competing solutions perform modifications to the
        Mac OS X install DVDs, such as a different boot loader and
        replaced files.
      </para>

      <para>
        Be aware of the following important issues before you attempt to
        install a Mac OS X guest:

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Mac OS X is commercial, licensed software and contains
            <emphasis role="bold">both license and technical
            restrictions</emphasis> that limit its use to certain
            hardware and usage scenarios. You must understand and comply
            with these restrictions.
          </para>

          <para>
            In particular, Apple prohibits the installation of most
            versions of Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware.
          </para>

          <para>
            These license restrictions are also enforced on a technical
            level. Mac OS X verifies that it is running on Apple
            hardware. Most DVDs that accompany Apple hardware check for
            the exact model. These restrictions are
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> circumvented by &product-name; and
            continue to apply.

            Intel CPU is newer than the Mac OS X build, or if you have a
            non-Intel CPU, you will likely encounter a panic during
            bootup with an "Unsupported CPU" exception.

            <emphasis>partitioned</emphasis>. So, the installer will not
            offer a partition selection to you. Before you can install
            the software successfully, start the Disk Utility from the

          is required for compatibility with other hypervisors. Windows

          support.
        </para>

        <para>
          Legacy guest OSes typically support OHCI and EHCI. These two
          controllers are needed because OHCI only handles USB low-speed

          The emulated USB controllers do not communicate directly with
          devices on the host. Instead they communicate with a virtual

            PIIX3 is the default chipset for most guests. For some guest

            (MSI). This enables modern OSes to address more PCI devices
            and no longer requires IRQ sharing. Using the ICH9 chipset
            it is also possible to configure up to 36 network cards,
            compared to a maximum of eight network adapters with PIIX3.
            Note that ICH9 support is experimental and not recommended

      If you created your VM with an older version of &product-name;,
      the default storage layout may differ. You might then only have an
      IDE controller to which both the CD/DVD drive and the hard disks
      have been attached. This might also apply if you selected an older
      OS type when you created the VM. Since older OSes do not support
      SATA without additional drivers, &product-name; will make sure
      that no such devices are present initially. See

      &product-name; also provides a <emphasis>floppy

      When you first create a virtual machine, &product-name; by default
      enables one virtual network card and selects the Network Address

      This default setup is good for the majority of &product-name;

    <title>Serial Ports</title>

    <para>
      &product-name; supports the use of virtual serial ports in a
      virtual machine.
    </para>

    <para>
      Ever since the original IBM PC, personal computers have been
      equipped with one or two serial ports, also called COM ports by
      DOS and Windows. Serial ports were commonly used with modems, and
      some computer mice used to be connected to serial ports before USB
      became commonplace.
    </para>

    <para>
      While serial ports are no longer as common as they used to be,
      there are still some important uses left for them. For example,
      serial ports can be used to set up a primitive network over a
      null-modem cable, in case Ethernet is not available. Also, serial
      ports are indispensable for system programmers needing to do
      kernel debugging, since kernel debugging software usually
      interacts with developers over a serial port. With virtual serial
      ports, system programmers can do kernel debugging on a virtual
      machine instead of needing a real computer to connect to.
    </para>

    <para>
      If a virtual serial port is enabled, the guest OS sees a standard
      16550A compatible UART device. Other UART types can be configured
      using the <command>VBoxManage modifyvm</command> command. Both
      receiving and transmitting data is supported. How this virtual
      serial port is then connected to the host is configurable, and the
      details depend on your host OS.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can use either the Settings tabs or the
      <command>VBoxManage</command> command to set up virtual serial
      ports. For the latter, see <xref linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" />
      for information on the <option>--uart</option>,

                in hexadecimal, and a colon separates the vendor from
                the product ID. For example,
                <literal>046d:c016</literal> stands for Logitech as a

        depths of 8, 16, 24, and 32 are accepted. EFI assumes a color

      <para>
        It is currently not possible to manipulate EFI variables from
        within a running guest. For example, setting the
        <literal>boot-args</literal> variable by running the
        <command>nvram</command> tool in a Mac OS X guest will not work.
        As an alternative method,
        <literal>VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs</literal> extradata can be
        passed to a VM in order to set the <literal>boot-args</literal>
        variable. To change the <literal>boot-args</literal> EFI
        variable, use the following command:
      </para>

<screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs &lt;value&gt;</screen>
