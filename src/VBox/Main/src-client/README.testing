This file contains some notes about things to try out to give the client-side
code in Main a reasonably thorough test.  We will add cases of things which
have been known to fail in the past to this file as we discover them.

*Linux guests*: changes should be tested against the following guests, or
equivalent vintages, preferably in 32-bit and 64-bit versions, with no
Additions and with 4.2 and 4.3 Additions and with single and dual screens:
CentOS 3, CentOS 5, CentOS 6, Current Ubuntu.

Mouse interface changes:
 * Test that mouse integration works.
 * Test that disabling mouse integration on the fly works.

Display interface changed:
 * Test that dynamic resizing works.
 * Test that switching to seamless mode and back works.
