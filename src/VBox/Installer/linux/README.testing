$Id: README.testing $
This file documents things which need testing when updating the Linux host
installers or anything which might indirectly affect them.  This should be
updated as we discover new things which could break.

General:

 * Test building, installing and running the run, RPM and Debian packages.
 * Test removing the packages - any errors?  Any files left behind?  Can the
   package be re-installed and run after removal?
 * Test upgrading them from any version we are likely to want to upgrade from.
   Make sure we can start.
 * Make sure that RPM/deb packages will not install if the run package is
   installed and vice-versa.

USB:

 * Make sure that /dev/vboxusb and /etc/udev/rules.d/60-vboxdrv.rules exist
   after installation with service start and do not exist after removal.  They
   should disappear when the vboxdrv service is stopped and re-appear when it
   is re-started.  This should also work when distribution packages are switched
   for run and vice-versa.

Services:

 * Make sure that the services start correctly on different types of system.
   Known supported cases:
  * old Redhat (e.g. RHEL 5 and earlier): sysvinit and chkconfig
  * old SUSE (12.0 and earlier): sysvinit and insserv
  * Gentoo: open-rc
  * very old Debian (5 and earlier): sysvinit, update-rc.d, non-dependency-based
  * old Debian (6 and 7): sysvinit, update-rc.d, dependency-based
  * Ubuntu (9.10 to 14.10): upstart
  * Ubuntu 14.10: systemd installed, upstart used
  * Recent non-Gentoo distributions: systemd
