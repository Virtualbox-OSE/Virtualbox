This document lists things which have been known to fail in the past with the
drm video driver and which should be tested regularly, e.g. when making code
changes or before releases.

 * Test that "auto-resize" is enabled in the GUI if user space supports it.
 * Test that old versions of Plymouth which do not report rectangles
   (pre-0.9.0/2014-05-20) update the screen correctly.
 * Having valid, non-overlapping offset hints on all screens has caused
   mouse integration and/or screen updates to break for fbdev, X.Org or
   GNOME Shell/Wayland.
 * Note that if a multi-screen VM is booted with only one screen enabled
   the fbdev console will be disabled on the others until reboot.  Test this
   configuration.
