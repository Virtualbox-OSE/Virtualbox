This is libcurl. Only the include & the lib folders are taken from the
distribution. See http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ for more info. We need a valid
lib/config.h to build the static library. On the UNIX platforms the
lib/config.h can be generated by using the following configure statement:

  ./configure --enable-http --enable-ftp --enable-file --enable-proxy  --enable-thread --enable-nonblocking --enable-verbose --disable-ares --disable-manual --disable-ldap --disable-ldaps --disable-sspi --enable-crypto-auth --enable-cookies --without-libssh2 --without-nss --without-libidn --without-ca-path --without-gnutls

On Windows-x86 the file lib/config-win32.h has been used as an initial template.

Place this file, Makefile.kmk & the config files in the form
config.h.TARGET.TARGET_ARCH in this directory after an update.

Updated to cURL 7.57.0.  Applied the diff against the previous version and fixed.  The config.h.* files were manually updated but not regenerated.  Tested by setting Version.kmk to an old version and running an update check in the GUI.
