 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_overview  Audio architecture overview
 *
 * The audio architecture mainly consists of two PDM interfaces,
 * PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR and PDMIHOSTAUDIO.
 *
 * The PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR interface is responsible of connecting a device
 * emulation, such as SB16, AC'97 and HDA to one or multiple audio backend(s).
 * Its API abstracts audio stream handling and I/O functions, device enumeration
 * and so on.
 *
 * The PDMIHOSTAUDIO interface must be implemented by all audio backends to
 * provide an abstract and common way of accessing needed functions, such as
 * transferring output audio data for playing audio or recording input from the
 * host.
 *
 * A device emulation can have one or more LUNs attached to it, whereas these
 * LUNs in turn then all have their own PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR, making it possible
 * to connect multiple backends to a certain device emulation stream
 * (multiplexing).
 *
 * An audio backend's job is to record and/or play audio data (depending on its
 * capabilities). It highly depends on the host it's running on and needs very
 * specific (host-OS-dependent) code. The backend itself only has very limited
 * ways of accessing and/or communicating with the PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR interface
 * via callbacks, but never directly with the device emulation or other parts of
 * the audio sub system.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_mixing    Mixing
 *
 * The AUDIOMIXER API is optionally available to create and manage virtual audio
 * mixers. Such an audio mixer in turn then can be used by the device emulation
 * code to manage all the multiplexing to/from the connected LUN audio streams.
 *
 * Currently only input and output stream are supported. Duplex stream are not
 * supported yet.
 *
 * This also is handy if certain LUN audio streams should be added or removed
 * during runtime.
 *
 * To create a group of either input or output streams the AUDMIXSINK API can be
 * used.
 *
 * For example: The device emulation has one hardware output stream (HW0), and
 * that output stream shall be available to all connected LUN backends. For that
 * to happen, an AUDMIXSINK sink has to be created and attached to the device's
 * AUDIOMIXER object.
 *
 * As every LUN has its own AUDMIXSTREAM object, adding all those
 * objects to the just created audio mixer sink will do the job.
 *
 * @note The AUDIOMIXER API is purely optional and is not used by all currently
 *       implemented device emulations (e.g. SB16).
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_data_processing   Data processing
 *
 * Audio input / output data gets handed off to/from the device emulation in an
 * unmodified (raw) way. The actual audio frame / sample conversion is done via
 * the PDMAUDIOMIXBUF API.
 *
 * This concentrates the audio data processing in one place and makes it easier
 * to test / benchmark such code.
 *
 * A PDMAUDIOFRAME is the internal representation of a single audio frame, which
 * consists of a single left and right audio sample in time. Only mono (1) and
 * stereo (2) channel(s) currently are supported.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_timing    Timing
 *
 * Handling audio data in a virtual environment is hard, as the human perception
 * is very sensitive to the slightest cracks and stutters in the audible data.
 * This can happen if the VM's timing is lagging behind or not within the
 * expected time frame.
 *
 * The two main components which unfortunately contradict each other is a) the
 * audio device emulation and b) the audio backend(s) on the host. Those need to
 * be served in a timely manner to function correctly. To make e.g. the device
 * emulation rely on the pace the host backend(s) set - or vice versa - will not
 * work, as the guest's audio system / drivers then will not be able to
 * compensate this accordingly.
 *
 * So each component, the device emulation, the audio connector(s) and the
 * backend(s) must do its thing *when* it needs to do it, independently of the
 * others. For that we use various (small) ring buffers to (hopefully) serve all
 * components with the amount of data *when* they need it.
 *
 * Additionally, the device emulation can run with a different audio frame size,
 * while the backends(s) may require a different frame size (16 bit stereo
 * -> 8 bit mono, for example).
 *
 * The device emulation can give the audio connector(s) a scheduling hint
 * (optional), e.g. in which interval it expects any data processing.
 *
 * A data transfer for playing audio data from the guest on the host looks like
 * this: (RB = Ring Buffer, MB = Mixing Buffer)
 *
 * (A) Device DMA -> (B) Device RB -> (C) Audio Connector %Guest MB -> (D) Audio
 * Connector %Host MB -> (E) Backend RB (optional, up to the backend) -> (F)
 * Backend audio framework.
 *
 * When capturing audio data the chain is similar to the above one, just in a
 * different direction, of course.
 *
 * The audio connector hereby plays a key role when it comes to (pre-)buffering
 * data to minimize any audio stutters and/or cracks. The following values,
 * which also can be tweaked via CFGM / extra-data are available:
 *
 * - The pre-buffering time (in ms): Audio data which needs to be buffered
 *   before any playback (or capturing) can happen.
 * - The actual buffer size (in ms): How big the mixing buffer (for C and D)
 *   will be.
 * - The period size (in ms): How big a chunk of audio (often called period or
 *   fragment) for F must be to get handled correctly.
 *
 * The above values can be set on a per-driver level, whereas input and output
 * streams for a driver also can be handled set independently. The verbose audio
 * (release) log will tell about the (final) state of each audio stream.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_diagram Diagram
 *
 * @todo r=bird: Not quite able to make sense of this, esp. the
 *       AUDMIXSINK/AUDIOMIXER bits crossing the LUN connections.
