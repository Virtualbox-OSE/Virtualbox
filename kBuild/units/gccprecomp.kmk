UNIT_gccprecomp = Target level precompiled Headers for Visual C++

#
# Early target processing pass #1.
#
# This sets $(target)_1_GCC_PCH_DIR as the include directory for the precompiled
# header, adding it to BLDDIRS to get a mkdir rule for it, and then calculates the
# .gch name and stores that in $(target)_1_GCC_PCH_FILE for compile rule dependencies.

#
# Early target processing pass #2.
#
# This sets up a rule for creating the .gch file after qt5 and similar units
# are done modifying INCS, DEFS and company.  The 'tool' variable is defined by
# footer-pass2-compiling-targets.kmk and is really the LD tool, but that'll
# have to do for now.  The '-PCH' variant of the GCC/LLVM tool, is defined together
# with $(tool) and allow us to bypass the options and dependencies triggered
# by _1_VCC_PCH_FILE, _1_VCC_COMMON_OBJ_PDB and _PCH_HDR, and also make sure we
# don't get circular dependencies by way of kDepObj and the debug info.
